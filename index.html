	<h2>Change is the only certainty in life.  When we are able to embrace change, we are able to craft and navigate our lives paths.  Without the ability to tolerate change, we become stuck on fighting the changing tide; trying to remain on steady ground and losing our footing in the process.</h2>

	<p>Change has been a consistent factor in my life.  Growing up in Iowa immersed me in the solid values of the Midwest.  Education on the West Coast allowed me to expand my views and learning base.  World travel connected me with people with whom I had little in common, or so it seemed on the surface.  It took little time to recognize the underlying themes of humanity, both positive and detrimental, that drive us all.  As an athlete, I understand and embrace the commitment to improvement through determination and hard work. As a parent, I have learned that nothing is as important as a healthy family life and a strong commitment to rewarding relationships.</p>

	<p>It is my strong opinion that health is a blend of physical, cognitive, emotional and spiritual balance.  Like the ripples in still water when the surface is moved, change cannot affect only one aspect of our being.  Psychology is an important component to overall health.  The psychological process for me is a special bond in which one person is entrusted to help another grow and reach his or her fullest potential.  The process of finding oneâ€™s strengths and learning to build on them is exciting!  It is not my practice to allow others to remain stuck in what is not working.  Rather, it is my goal to help individuals and families propel themselves to higher levels of performance and life satisfaction. </p>

	<p>The methods I utilize include Cognitive Behavioral therapy in the forms of health psychology, relaxation and biofeedback training, psychological evaluation, leadership coaching, and psychosocial education.  Individuals gain insight and new skills through the homework assignments that are created at each session.  I enjoy working with individuals across the life span either alone, in families, groups or work environments.  Psychological evaluations and leadership assessments are services that I offer to enhance individual outcomes. </p>
