	<h3>Professional Endeavors</h3>
	<p>I went to <a href="http://www.cofo.edu/"> College of the Ozarks</a>, "Hard Work U," and discovered my love for people and the desire to help others during my time there.  I began my graduate work at <a href="http://www.cofo.edu/"> St. Louis University</a>, focusing on Marriage and Family Therapy and Family Systems theories. I completed my degree at <a href="https://www.missouristate.edu/"> Missouri State University</a>, focusing on the Community Agency aspect of therapy. I was in private practice for almost two years after finishing my coursework, and began working at <a href="http://www.thevictimcenter.org/"> The Victim Center</a> in Springfield, MO. where I worked for six years practicing trauma-focused therapy with victims of violent and sexual crimes, as well as secondary victims whose family members and loved ones were affected by crime. My experience there, the training and experience over those six years, has been invaluable in both my own worldview and belief systems, as well as in the work I do with clients who are ready for a change.  I have been trained in <a href="https://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/viewintervention.aspx?id=135"> Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a>, and am in the process of being rostered in that therapy modality.</p>
