		<p>Change is inevitable--it is as sure as death and taxes. And yet, change can be many different things.  It can be something that we dread, dragging our feet as we are led toward it, OR it can be something we go looking for, like a pirate with a treasure map, like DeSoto looking for the fountain of youth.</p>

		<p>My viewpoint is that change is a sign of growth, or forward motion, and few things can compare.</p>

		<p>I wear many hats. I am a wife. I am a mother. I am a daughter, a sister, a friend. I am a therapist, a helper, a teacher, a listener. Having done much changing myself, and having watched and walked with many others as they change, there are few things more exhilarating than having that epiphany or "ah-ha" moment. That is my goal as a therapist at Center of Change... to help walk with you, to help guide you to your own "ah-ha" moments... those moments that will change you, your life, and how you see things, and will propel you forward toward the life you want and the best version of you possible.</p>

		<p>Born in Missouri, I spent my formative years in both Oklahoma and Missouri. I grew up rooted in strong traditional values, and spent some time in late adolescence challenging and discovering what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to change. This left me with a firm foundation, and a "house" of beliefs that are both well-established and my own.</p>
