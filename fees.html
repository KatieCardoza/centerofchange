	<h1>Fee Structure</h1>

	<p>Fees vary based on the service provided.  Please contact us for information regarding what fees will be assessed for the service you are seeking.  See rates below.</p>
	
	<p>At Center of Change it is the policy that payment in full will be due at the time of service.  If individuals would like to have their invoices filed with their insurance providers, we will do that for them.  The insurance company generally will reimburse the policy holder directly for whatever services are covered.  Insurance companies may have separate deductibles for mental health coverage.  It is the responsibility of the individuals seeking treatment to be aware of the services covered by their insurance provider.  However, it is not necessary for us to file with the insurance company if that is not in the best interest of the individual.</p>
	<p>There may be times when an individual chooses not to utilize the insurance coverage available.  For example, the deductible may be too high to reasonably meet during the normal course of therapeutic treatment.  Prior diagnoses may increase the rate of insurance coverage in the future.  There are also some diagnoses that, if made through an insurer, may prevent individuals from pursuing certain career choices.  Likewise if insurance is provided through an employer, there is a risk that the information may not remain confidential to all employees within the organization.  We want our patients to be aware of their options and the potential consequences of those different choices.</p>

	<p>Accepted methods of payment include cash, check, or credit card (Visa, MasterCard and Discover Card).</p>
